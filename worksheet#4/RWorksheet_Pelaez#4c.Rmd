# The result, and it produced such output:
# The engine displacement (displ) increases, highway MPG (hwy) decreases.
# This is because larger engines generally consume more fuel, reducing fuel efficiency.
# The color gradient for city MPG (cty) reinforces this trend, as city and highway efficiencies tend to align.
